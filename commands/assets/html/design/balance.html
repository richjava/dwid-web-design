        <p>Let's say you have a product, a portfolio, or just an idea you want to share with everyone on your
            <em>own</em> website. Before you publish it on the internet, you want to make it look attractive,
            professional, or at least <em>decent</em> to look at.</p>
        <p>What is the <i>first thing</i> you need to work on?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>The purpose of <strong>design</strong> is to enhance the presentation of the content it's applied to. It
            might sound obvious, but content being the <strong>primary</strong> element of a website, it should not be
            established as an afterthought.</p>
        <p>Written content, like the paragraph you're currently reading, makes up for more than 90% of the Web. Styling
            this textual content will go a long way.</p>
        <p>Let's assume you've already finalised the content you want to publish and just created an empty <code>style.css</code>
            file, what is the <i>first rule</i> you can write?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Centering</h2>
        <p>Long lines of text can be hard to parse, and thus hard to <strong>read</strong>. Setting a limit of
            characters per line greatly enhances the readability and appeal of a wall of text.</p>
        <pre><span class="selector">body</span> {
  <span class="attribute">margin</span>: <span class="number">0</span> auto;
  <span class="attribute">max-width</span>: <span class="number">50</span><span class="unit">em</span>;
}</pre>
        <p>After styling the text <em>blocks</em>, what about styling the <i>text itself</i>?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Font family</h2>
        <p>The browser's font defaults to <code>"Times"</code>, which can look unappealing (mostly because it is the
            "unstyled" font). Switching to a <strong>sans-serif</strong> font like <code>"Helvetica"</code> or <code>"Arial"</code>
            can vastly improve the look of your page.</p>
        <pre><span class="selector">body</span> {
  <span class="attribute">font-family</span>: <span class="string">"Helvetica"</span>, <span
                    class="string">"Arial"</span>, sans-serif;
}</pre>
        <p><em>If you want to stick with a serif font, try <code>"Georgia"</code>.</em></p>
        <p>While this makes the text more <em>appealing</em>, let's also make it <i>more readable</i>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Spacing</h2>
        <p>When a page looks "broken" to a user, it's usually a <strong>spacing</strong> issue. Providing space both
            <em>around</em> and <em>within</em> your content can increase the appeal of your page.</p>
        <pre><span class="selector">body</span> {
  <span class="attribute">line-height</span>: <span class="number">1.5</span>;
  <span class="attribute">padding</span>: <span class="number">4</span><span class="unit">em</span> <span
                    class="number">1</span><span class="unit">em</span>;
}

<span class="selector">h2</span> {
  <span class="attribute">margin-top</span>: <span class="number">1</span><span class="unit">em</span>;
  <span class="attribute">padding-top</span>: <span class="number">1</span><span class="unit">em</span>;
}</pre>
        <p>While the layout has greatly improved so far, let's apply more <i>subtle changes</i>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Color &amp; contrast</h2>
        <p>Black text on a white background can be harsh on the eyes. Opting for a softer shade of black for body text
            makes the page more <strong>comfortable</strong> to read.</p>
        <pre><span class="selector">body</span> {
  <span class="attribute">color</span>: <span class="number">#555</span>;
}</pre>
        <p>And in order to keep a decent level of <strong>contrast</strong>, let's pick a darker shade for <strong>important</strong>
            words</p>
        <pre><span class="selector">h1</span>,
<span class="selector">h2</span>,
<span class="selector">strong</span> {
  <span class="attribute">color</span>: <span class="number">#333</span>;
}</pre>
        <p>While most of the page has been improved visually, some elements (like the code snippets) still seem <i>out
            of place</i>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Balance</h2>
        <p>It only takes a few additional touches to correct the balance of the page:</p>
        <pre><span class="selector">code</span>,
<span class="selector">pre</span> {
  <span class="attribute">background</span>: <span class="number">#eee</span>;
}

<span class="selector">code</span> {
  <span class="attribute">padding</span>: <span class="number">2</span>px <span class="number">4</span>px;
  <span class="attribute">vertical-align</span>: text-bottom;
}

<span class="selector">pre</span> {
  <span class="attribute">padding</span>: <span class="number">1</span>em;
}</pre>
        <p>At this point, you might want to make your page stand out and give it <i>identity</i>.
        </p>
