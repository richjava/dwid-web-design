        <p>Let's say you have a product, a portfolio, or just an idea you want to share with everyone on your <em>own</em> website. Before you publish it on the internet, you want to make it look attractive, professional, or at least <em>decent</em> to look at.</p>
        <p>What is the <i>first thing</i> you need to work on?</p>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>The purpose of <strong>design</strong> is to enhance the presentation of the content it's applied to. It might sound obvious, but content being the <strong>primary</strong> element of a website, it should not be established as an afterthought.</p>
        <p>Written content, like the paragraph you're currently reading, makes up for more than 90% of the Web. Styling this textual content will go a long way.</p>
        <p>Let's assume you've already finalised the content you want to publish and just created an empty <code>style.css</code> file, what is the <i>first rule</i> you can write?</p>

        <h2>Centering</h2>
        <p>Long lines of text can be hard to parse, and thus hard to <strong>read</strong>. Setting a limit of characters per line greatly enhances the readability and appeal of a wall of text.</p>
        <pre><span class="selector">body</span> {
  <span class="attribute">margin</span>: <span class="number">0</span> auto;
  <span class="attribute">max-width</span>: <span class="number">50</span><span class="unit">em</span>;
}</pre>
        <p>After styling the text <em>blocks</em>, what about styling the <i>text itself</i>?</p>
